        <h1>We perform child custody investigations throughout Wyoming.</h1>

        <p>
          It’s a sad reality that Wyoming has one of the highest divorce rates — by some measures, the third highest — in the country.

          Divorce is stressful on adults, but for children, divorce can be devastating, as can the resulting custody battles. That’s where Healthy Frontier Counseling can help.

        <h1>When to Pursue...</h1>
        <p>
          When parents divorce and are not able to mutually agree on how decisions involving the children are going to be made or how much time the children will spend at each parent’s home, they often pursue a custody investigation. A custody investigation is a process whereby an <b>objective</b> and <b>trained</b> investigator gathers information about a variety of factors related to the children and parents (or prospective caregivers). The results are then shared with legal council, parents and, if necessary, the courts.
